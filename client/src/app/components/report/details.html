    Cumulative Flow Diagram is an analytical tool, fundamental to Kanban method. It allows teams to visualize their effort and project progress. When there's an impediment about to occur within the process - the CFD is where you'll see it first. Instead of the graph staying smooth and rising gently, there will be a bump, a sudden ascend
or descend. So, where being able to predict problems is concerned, this is the very graph you need.

<h1>
    What does it show?
</h1>
<p>The Cumulative Flow Diagram visualises how tasks mount up over time, together with their distribution along the process stages. The graph is built from different colored bands of tasks gathered in various columns. One color represents one column - so that each band shows how many tasks sit at what stage of the process, in a given time - the horizontal value.</p>
<h1>
        How should it look?    
</h1>
<p>
        The ideal diagram you want to see is an evenly rising one, with bands staying more-less even, except for the "completed tasks" band, which should continuously be getting taller, just as the number of done tasks is hopefully always getting higher.
